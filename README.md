# One Player Sleep Data Pack for Minecraft 1.14

This One Player Sleep Data Pack allows a player to skip the night on a Multiplayer Server.

When a player sleeps, and others are on the server. This datapack fast forwards the night, completing in a few seconds.
It also announces to chat who is now sleeping.

If someone is sleeping in your bed. This datapack also gives you the ability to hit them, and wake them up!


Some of the features include:
  - Plug and Play. Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder and the functions will install automatically
  - Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
  - Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skipping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.

Version 2.2 Features:
  - Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
  - Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.

Version 2.3 Features:
  - Weather changes to cycle the weather often.

Version 2.4 Features:
  - Better weather control.
  - Players now can stop storms if they go to sleep when is daytime.
  - Fix: Time would advance for a long time if it was storming in the morning and players were sleeping.
  Now storms end when the sun comes up and the player will naturally get woken up.
  - The weather will only be affected in case of thunderstorm during the day (and players taking action). This data pack does not change the weather with regular sleeping at night.

  - Support for Minecraft 1.14 snapshots. Mojang removed the "Sleeping" NBT from their data model.
  - Added compatibility! Data pack will work in Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14
  - Fixed some messages to be gender neutral.
  - Commented gamerule sendCommandFeedback, this made some people crazy thinking I broke their Minecraft server.
  - Tested in Snapshot 19w09a and Minecraft 1.14 Pre-releases.
  - Changed the waking up feature to something more clever than silly snowballs thrown at players
  - Tested in Minecraft 1.13.2 Works as expected
