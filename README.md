# One Player Sleep Data Pack for Minecraft 1.13

This One Player Sleep Data Pack allows a player to skip the night on a Multiplayer Server.

Some of the features include:
  - Plug and Play. Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder and the functions will install automatically
  - Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
  - Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skiping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.

Version 2.2 Features:
  - Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
  - Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.

Version 2.3 Features:
  - Weather changes to cycle the weather often.

Version 2.4 Features:
  - Better weather control.
  - Players now can stop storms if they go to sleep when is daytime.
  - Fix: Time would advance for a long time if it was storming in the morning and players were sleeping.
  Now storms end when the sun comes up and the player will naturally get woken up.
  - The weather will only be affected in case of thunderstorm during the day (and players taking action). This data pack does not change the weather with regular sleeping at night.
