# One Player Sleep Data Pack for Minecraft 1.13

This One Player Sleep Data Pack allows a player to skip the night on a Multiplayer Server.

Some of the features include:
  - Plug and Play. Drop the zip file in the datapacks folder and the functions will install automatically
  - Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
  - Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skiping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.

Version 2.2 Features:
  - Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
  - Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.
  - Uninstaller to clean up scoreboards and disable the data pack.
